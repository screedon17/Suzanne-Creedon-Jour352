<p>Just west of Baltimore in Howard County lies the flood-prone Ellicott City, Maryland. Wedged between both the Patapsco River and Tiber Creek tributary including the Hudson and the New Cut Branches, the city has had its fair share of flooding incidents in the past significantly beginning in 1868. Since then, the area (mostly the historic town center) has flooded at over ten times. <br><br>All three creeks in the tributary connect around Main Street which is conveniently located at the base of the valley. As they are a part of the Patapsco River watershed, they flow down hill into the valley and with high amounts of rainfall in short spans of time, the drainage and runoff system can’t handle the rapid influx of water so it ends up flooding into the city and down the streets. <br></p>

<center><h1>These floods shouldn’t be happening as often as they are.</h1></center>

<p>The first record of a significant flood occurred in 1868, with water levels rising to 21.5 ft and killing 43 people, they call it The Great Flood. With many more since then, the 1972 flood caused by Hurricane Agnes had water rising up to 14.5 ft which was the worst recorded flood since disaster in 1868. Most of the floods in the towns history are “1000 year floods” which according to the United States Geological Survey means “statistically speaking, a flood of that magnitude (or greater) has a 1 in 1,000 chance of occurring in any given year. In terms of probability, the 1,000-year flood has a 0.1% chance of happening in any given year (USGS).</p>

  <h2>How Many Lives have we Lost?</h2>
    <p>With these disaters all mostly being instantaneous, the residents of Ellicott City don't have time to prepare so much before hand, they're always caught off guard by the flash flooding. This has sometime had a serious effect on the residents of the city.</p>

<p>There have been plans that have been proposed to try and prevent the floods from being so bad in the future but there always seems to be an issue with them. The preservationists want to keep the historic validity of the city while its citizens who live there and don’t have the option to move just want a solution so they can stay where they are. Nicholas Redding, executive director of Preservation Maryland officials should consider building tunnels underneath Main Street and accelerating upstream projects as a way to avoid flooding in the future. However, since the city is build on a granite slab, drilling tunnels to increase paths for runoff isn’t a very practical option.
<br><br>Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) had proposed a plan to begin drilling into the earth in hopes of increasing drainage and accelerating upstream projects as a way to avoid flooding in the future but a former council member told him they considered attempting it before but just could not find a logistical way of drilling into granite hills.</p>

<p>If historians and preservationists are going to stay worried about keeping the historic sense of the town, there going to have to find a different way and fast or people in the city will begin to leave and the flooding isn’t going to stop.
