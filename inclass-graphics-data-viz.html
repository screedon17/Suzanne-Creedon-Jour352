<p>Just west of Baltimore in Howard County lies the flood-prone Ellicott City, Maryland. Wedged between both the Patapsco River and Tiber Creek tributary including the Hudson and the New Cut Branches, the city has had its fair share of flooding incidents in the past significantly beginning in 1868. Since then, the area (mostly the historic town center) has flooded at over ten times.</p>

  </figure>

<p>All three creeks in the tributary connect around Main Street which is conveniently located at the base of the valley. As they are a part of the Patapsco River watershed, they flow down hill into the valley and with high amounts of rainfall in short spans of time, the drainage and runoff system can’t handle the rapid influx of water so it ends up flash flooding into the city and down the streets. Another way the city ends up underwater is from slow but constant levels of rainfall. This encourages the gradual rise of the Patapsco River even if the drainage systems are not overloaded. So, rather than flash flooding in this case, the water comes from the overflow of the river.</p>

<p>The first record of a significant flood occurred in 1868, with water levels rising to 21.5 ft and killing 43 people, they call it The Great Flood. With many more since then, the 1972 flood caused by Hurricane Agnes had water rising up to 14.5 ft which was the worst recorded flood since disaster in 1868. Most of the floods in the towns history are “1000 year floods” which according to the United States Geological Survey means “statistically speaking, a flood of that magnitude (or greater) has a 1 in 1,000 chance of occurring in any given year. In terms of probability, the 1,000-year flood has a 0.1% chance of happening in any given year (USGS).</p>

<h1>The Flood of 2016</h1>

<p><img style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;" src="Photos/2016_rainfall.png" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;"> In the span of <strong>two hours</strong>, six inches of rain fell over the area surrounding Ellicott City on July 30, 2016. With this being such a large level of rainfall in such a short amout of time, the city's drainage system couldn't handle the volume thus overflowing in flash floods down Main Street. Homes, businesses, sidewalks, streets, parks and landmarks; you name it, it was probably damaged. 35 year-old Jessica Watsula and 38 year-old Joseph A. Blevins were the only two casualties that day, however even with only two, the city mourned together. After over two months of restoration, Main Street reopened to vehicle and pedestrian traffic on October 6, 2016.</p>

<h1>The Flood of 2018</h1>
<p>On May 27, 2018 Ellicott City, MD recieved over <strong>9.71 inches</strong> of rain in the same span of 2 hours like that of the 2016 flood. The flood of 2016 was labeled as a "1000 year flood" meaning that it's only likely to have a flood that bad every one thousand years. But 2018 had to prove them wrong and come back with one even worse than before. The flash flooding levels of the 2018 flood reached heights of more than 10 feet high. Since all of the buildings on Main Street keep sustaining so much damage from the flooding, the state and local government officials are trying to pass legislations to demolish some of the historic buildings that are becoming structurally unsound from flood damage. <br><br>
Sadly, the life of Sgt. Eddison A. Hermond, 39, a National Guard member and U.S. Air Force veteran was taken from the community.

  <h2>How Many Lives have been Lost?</h2>
    <p>With these disaters all mostly being instantaneous, the residents of Ellicott City don't have time to prepare so much before hand, they're always caught off guard by the flash flooding. This has sometime had a serious effect on the residents of the city. With the increase in technology and the ease of having a way out of a situation like this, people are more adaptable when they're under pressure.</p>

<p>There have been plans that have been proposed to try and prevent the floods from being so bad in the future but there always seems to be an issue with them. The preservationists want to keep the historic validity of the city while its citizens who live there and don’t have the option to move just want a solution so they can stay where they are. Nicholas Redding, executive director of Preservation Maryland officials should consider building tunnels underneath Main Street and accelerating upstream projects as a way to avoid flooding in the future. However, since the city is build on a granite slab, drilling tunnels to increase paths for runoff isn’t a very practical option.
<br><br>Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) had proposed a plan to begin drilling into the earth in hopes of increasing drainage and accelerating upstream projects as a way to avoid flooding in the future but a former council member told him they considered attempting it before but just could not find a logistical way of drilling into granite hills.</p>

<p>If historians and preservationists are going to stay worried about keeping the historic sense of the town, there going to have to find a different way and fast or people in the city will begin to leave and the flooding isn’t going to stop.
